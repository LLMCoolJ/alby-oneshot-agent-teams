  "decisions": [
    "App.tsx already had lazy import for 2-LightningAddress wired up from spec 06, so no modification needed",
    "Replaced placeholder page in 2-LightningAddress/index.tsx with full implementation from spec",
    "Uncommented useLightningAddressPayment export on line 10 of hooks/index.ts",
    "Rewrote spec's test file to use module-level mock functions (matching SimplePayment.test.tsx pattern) instead of require() calls which don't work with vitest module aliasing",
    "Added data-testid attributes: address-display, address-input, amount-input, comment-input, submit-button, success-message",
    "Used LightningAddress from @getalby/lightning-tools/lnurl subpath as specified"
